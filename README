This project makes SAGA functionality available via Thrift by using Java SAGA
as a backend to more than a dozen different programming languages. For more
information see the Master Thesis: One SAGA for All.

To get this up and running you need the following:
- Java >=1.5
- Java SAGA and the env variable JAVA_SAGA_LOCATION pointing to it
- ant
- thrift >= 0.6, make sure you use the correct path for the thrift libraries
